In the past decade, crowd funding has become a force for real and positive change both from within and across the current web 2.0 landscape. It has given individuals and communities both online and off the opportunity to give to what they believe in. With the rise of new decentralized peer-to-peer platforms such as Ethereum, we can realize this cause in a more free, open and secure way. With good design, community driven ideas, open-source technologies, secure decentralized peer-to-peer platforms, and the mindset that everyone should have equal and unencumbered access to crowd funding platforms without the burden of unnecessary fees to participate; Crowdfundrr hopes to materialize, at the very least, a part of this new unexplored crowd funding vision.
