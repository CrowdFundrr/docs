# Welcome to Weifund

WeiFund is an open platform for crowdfunding campaigns. You can launch a campaign using one of Weifund’s secure smart contract templates (“Campaign Templates”) that we develop, or you can integrate your own smart contracts to create a custom campaign - the details of that integration are outlined below in this documentation. Weifund is built on Ethereum.

With a strong focus on security and smart contract best practices, Weifund makes it easy to launch a safe campaign that works in the Weifund user interfaces. Vetting systems provide users with assessments of campaign readiness, allowing communities to confidently fund selected campaigns. WeiFund provides both Weifund.io, our campaign portal, and clients that interact with campaigns and which are accessible from IPFS.

## Ropsten Testnet & Livenet
As Campaign Templates are rolled-out, the WeiFund platform will support both the Ethereum (ETH) livenet and testnet. Features will emerge first on the testnet and then once validated may be released to production on the mainnet. The WeiFund portal and client can detect which network you are on and set the contract addresses accordingly. However, please ensure you are on the desired network before proceeding with creating or interacting with any WeiFund contract or listed campaign. We recommend you use and experiment with WeiFund on the Etheruem testnet before publishing your campaign to the livenet on WeiFund.
