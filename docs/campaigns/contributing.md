## Set Up A Wallet

WeiFund will ask you for the seed phrase for your Ethereum wallet. If you already have a wallet in Metamask, you can paste your seed into WeiFund. If you don't, you can generate a new wallet at lightwallet.io. Remember to follow the instructions to back up your wallet safely!

## Get Ether

WeiFund contributions are paid in ether, the currency of the Ethereum blockchain. The Ethereum network also collects a small fee (usually less than 0.10 USD) to send transactions. We recommend using Coinbase to buy ether. From there, you can send the either to your lightwallet address.

For some people in certain jurisdictions or for those wanting to acquire a larger amount of ether, you may want to use one of these exchanges:

* [Poloniex](https://poloniex.com/)
* [Kraken](https://www.kraken.com/)
* [BitStamp](https://www.bitstamp.net/)
* [Bitfinex](https://www.bitfinex.com/)
* [BTCChina](https://www.btcc.com/)

1. Open the WeiFund portal or client
2. Select the campaign to which you would like to contribute
