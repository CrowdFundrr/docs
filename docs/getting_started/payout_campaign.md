#Paying out to a Beneficiary
A Beneficiary is the recipient of funds from a successful campaign on Weifund. Beneficiaries are simply Ethereum addresses; they can be simple account addresses or another smart contract. Funds are typically stored in the campaign smart contracts until the campaign ends. To have the funds transferred to the Beneficiary, a payout transaction must be sent to the campaign smart contract system. By default anyone can initiate the payout functions of Standard Campaigns, however it is of course possible to restrict this access, and irrelevant to who initiates the payout, only the owner of the beneficiary account will be able to receive the campaign funds.
